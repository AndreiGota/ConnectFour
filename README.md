# ðŸŽ® Connect 4 
 Connect 4 game built in python.

## How to play:
The two players take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid (the size of the grid can be changed). The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the selected column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.

## Features:
1. Console User Interface
2. Graphical User Interface, built with the Tkinter framework
3. AI - implemented using the MiniMax Algorithm
4. All modules with the exception of the UI are covered with specifications and PyUnit test cases
5. Layered Architecture
6. 2 strategies that can be used by the computer
7. Customizable board size, initially set to standard: seven-column, six-row

## Settings
The users can change the game settings before launching the game (e.g., choosing between playing the game in the console or in a GUI, each player's name and whether they are controlled by an AI or not, and the strategy used by the AI for each player). This can be done by modifying the ```settings.properties``` file. The default settings are the following:
```
[DEFAULT]
ui_type = "GUI"
first_player_type = "Human"
first_player_name = "Yellow"
first_player_ai = ""
second_player_type = "Computer"
second_player_name = "Red"
second_player_ai = "Smart"
```
The ```ui_type``` can be either ```GUI``` or ```Console```, the types of each player can be ```Human``` or ```Computer``` and the AI type can be either ```Smart```, which employs a minimax strategy, or ```Random```, which chooses moves randomly.
